# Working in this repository

Run `pnpm check` after every change. It is the same command CI runs, and a failing check names the
command that fixes it (`pnpm check:fix` repairs everything a machine can).

## Standard commands

Every personal repository answers to the same commands:

| Command                       | What it does                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm bootstrap`              | Install dependencies, wire git hooks, and run preflight        |
| `pnpm preflight`              | Confirm the machine can build and deploy this repository       |
| `pnpm preflight --production` | Report whether production has everything `platform.json` lists |
| `pnpm bootstrap --production` | Set up whatever production is missing, asking for values       |
| `pnpm check`                  | Format, docs, shape rules, lint, types, tests, repo checks     |
| `pnpm check:fix`              | Apply formatting and lint fixes                                |
| `pnpm build`                  | Build every package                                            |
| `pnpm test`                   | Run every package's tests                                      |
| `pnpm run deploy`             | Build, then `wrangler deploy` every app (deployable repos)     |
| `turbo gen workspace`         | Scaffold a new package or app                                  |

## Create GitHub issues and pull requests

Use the mandatory `github-contribution` skill from the `willie-contributions` plugin whenever a user
authorizes creating an issue or pull request. It carries the organization checklist, readable
templates, and the only approved creation helper:

```bash
node node_modules/@williecubed/cli/plugins/willie-contributions/scripts/github-create.mjs issue \
  --type bug|feature --title <title> --body-file <file>
node node_modules/@williecubed/cli/plugins/willie-contributions/scripts/github-create.mjs pr \
  --title <title> --body-file <file> --base main
```

Preview with `--dry-run --json` and inspect the complete Markdown before creating anything. Do not
call `gh issue create`, `gh pr create`, equivalent `gh api` routes, or connector creation tools
directly.

## Commit messages

Subjects are conventional: `type(scope): description`, at most 72 characters. Scopes are optional
and come only from [`.williecubed/commit-scopes.txt`](.williecubed/commit-scopes.txt). Omit the
scope when a change crosses boundaries; never invent one for a feature, file, task, or role.

## The repository standard

Lint, format, TypeScript, and test settings extend the `@williecubed/*` packages from
`WillieCubed/repository-tooling`. Change a shared rule there, not here.
