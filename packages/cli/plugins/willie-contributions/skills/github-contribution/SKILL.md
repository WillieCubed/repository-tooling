# Create a GitHub contribution

Use the native, readable repository templates. Never construct hidden metadata or call a GitHub
creation command directly.

## Mandatory checklist

1. Confirm that the user authorized creating the issue or pull request.
2. Search the repository for an issue or open pull request covering the work.
3. Choose the bug, feature, or pull request template from this skill's `assets/`.
4. Write complete, concise repository-specific prose. The TL;DR names the outcome a person can use
   or observe; Changes explains the important behavior, constraint, or trade-off without becoming a
   file inventory. Follow-ups and Next Work is always present; it names unfinished product or
   reliability objectives, never chores such as rebasing, formatting, or running checks, and says
   `None.` when there are none. Use `feat` in a pull-request title only for a capability someone can
   use or observe; groundwork belongs under a more precise conventional type. Commit scopes are
   optional. Read the current repository's `.williecubed/commit-scopes.txt` before using one; the
   shared helper validates that repository-owned list. Omit the scope rather than inventing one for
   a feature, file, task, or role.
5. For a pull request, confirm the branch is pushed and run the repository's required validation
   command.
6. Run the helper with `--dry-run` and inspect the complete title and body.
7. Run the same helper without `--dry-run` to create the item.
8. Return the verified URL emitted by the helper.

## Commands

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/github-create.mjs" issue \
  --type bug|feature --title <title> --body-file <file> --dry-run

node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/github-create.mjs" pr \
  --title <conventional-title> --body-file <file> --base main --dry-run
```

Add `--json` for machine-readable output. Remove `--dry-run` only after the preview is correct. Do
not replace the helper with `gh issue create`, `gh pr create`, `gh api`, or a GitHub connector.
