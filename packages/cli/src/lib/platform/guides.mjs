/**
 * What the standard knows about the services behind a manifest: the DNS
 * records an email provider needs, the dashboard pages to open, and the
 * click-by-click steps for the parts no API can do. Keeping them here means
 * every repository gets the same, reviewed instructions.
 *
 * Every guide assumes the person has never used the service before, so each
 * step says exactly what to type or choose, and where a copied value goes.
 * A guide never asks for a second copy before the first is pasted: each
 * copied value goes into its destination (this command's prompt, a
 * dashboard field, a file) straight away, and a value needed in two places
 * is pasted in both before anything else is copied.
 * The labels follow the dashboards as they were on 2026-09-23 and the
 * providers' own documentation:
 *   - developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/setup/
 *   - developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/google-workspace/
 *   - developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/
 *   - developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/validating-json/
 *   - developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/
