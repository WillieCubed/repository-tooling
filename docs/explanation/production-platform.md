# Why production is declared in a platform manifest

Every personal repository that runs a Worker needs the same kinds of things in production: a
database with its migrations applied, a bucket, a bot check, a sign-in in front of the admin pages,
an email domain, secrets, and deploy credentials. Before this existed, each repository kept that
knowledge in comments inside the wrangler config, in its README, and in one bespoke bootstrap
script, and the Access application and zone rules were set up by hand in the dashboard. Nothing said
when production was complete. This page explains how the standard replaces that.

## One file says what production needs

The repository declares production in `platform.json`: every resource, every secret with its purpose
and the steps to find it, and every value that must never be there. The file holds names and
instructions, never values, so it is safe to commit and review like code. Because it is data, the
standard can check it, report on it, and act on it the same way in every repository.

## Checking and fixing share one plan

`pnpm preflight --production` and `pnpm bootstrap --production` read the same manifest and the same
live state, and produce the same list of items with the same statuses. The check prints the list.
Setup prints it too, then acts on each open item. Keeping one plan means the report can never claim
something that setup would not do, and it means the planning, the part with the decisions, is tested
without touching a network.

Setup keeps no record of its own progress. Each run starts by reading what actually exists, so it
resumes exactly where the last run stopped, after a skipped question, a failed step, or a change
someone made in a dashboard.

## Running it twice changes nothing

Every step checks before it acts, so a second run on a finished setup makes no changes and says so.
That rule shapes several choices. Resources are found by name across every page of Cloudflare's
lists, and a list that cannot be read to the end stops the run rather than making a resource look
missing, because a missing resource would be created a second time. A secret that is set is never
asked for, generated, or copied again, since setup cannot read a secret's value to tell whether it
is current. Migrations run only when some are unapplied, and only against the database the config
names. Replacing a value is something a person asks for by name with `--rotate`; it is never a side
effect of running setup. A test runs setup twice against fake services and fails if the second run
changes anything.

## Credentials stay where they already are

Reading uses what a maintainer already has: Wrangler's sign-in for Workers, D1, and R2, `gh` for
GitHub, and public DNS for email records. Only Turnstile and Access need more, because Wrangler's
sign-in cannot manage them. For those, setup asks for a short-lived API token through a link that
pre-selects the permissions, keeps it in memory, and never writes it anywhere. Secret values follow
the same rule: they travel to Wrangler and `gh` on standard input, never as arguments, and are never
printed.

## Some things stay manual on purpose

Setup never edits `wrangler.jsonc`. A var such as a Turnstile site key belongs in the reviewed
config, because a deploy replaces every var with what the config says; setup prints the exact line
to add instead. Turning on Zero Trust, connecting Google Workspace, and verifying an email domain
have no API, so setup prints numbered dashboard steps and waits. Those steps assume the person has
never used the service: they say what to type in each field, where each copied value goes, and what
it looks like. Deleting a forbidden secret is offered, never done without asking.

## Where the design came from

LVBT's repository tooling generalized the ideas first: a list of secrets with a purpose, a link, and
click-by-click steps; values the tool can mint itself; a read-only report; and grouping by whether a
live feature is waiting. WPP's `scripts/bootstrap.sh` had reached the same shape on its own, with
idempotent checks and secrets piped straight to Wrangler. The personal standard uses LVBT's schema
and command, and adds what WPP set up by hand: the shared allowlist policy and zone rules.
