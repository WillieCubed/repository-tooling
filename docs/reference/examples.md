# The example repositories

Each directory under `examples/` is a complete Turborepo workspace that `create-turbo` copies to
start a new repository, and that a template repository mirrors. It is the standard, in runnable
form: a test in this repository copies each example into a temporary directory and proves it passes
its own `check` with the shared packages.

| Example           | For                                                 | Template repository        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `basic`           | A library, CLI, or Cloudflare Worker workspace      | `template-basic`           |
| `with-astro`      | An Astro site deployed to Cloudflare Workers        | `template-with-astro`      |
| `with-vite-react` | A Vite and React application deployed to Cloudflare | `template-with-vite-react` |

The example remains the authoritative source for application-owned template files. During
publication, the workflow copies it, vendors the exact tagged `willie-web` preset, adds
`standards:update` and `standards:check`, and rewrites every `@williecubed/*` dependency to the
appropriate local `file:` path. Running publication again for the same tag produces the same files.

## What the deployable examples add

`with-astro` and `with-vite-react` carry everything above, minus `packages/example`, plus:

| Path                           | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/site` or `apps/app`      | The application: source under `src/`, unit tests under `tests/`, end-to-end tests under `tests/e2e/` |
| `apps/*/wrangler.jsonc`        | A static-assets Worker serving `dist/`; `pnpm run deploy` deploys every app that has one             |
| `apps/*/playwright.config.ts`  | Spreads `@williecubed/playwright-config` and starts the app's `preview` server                       |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Validates, then runs `pnpm run deploy` on every push to `main` with the Cloudflare secrets           |
| root `preview` and `deploy`    | `turbo run preview` and `cube deploy`                                                                |

The Astro example also adds `prettier-plugin-astro` to its Prettier config and extends
`@williecubed/typescript-config/astro.json`; the React example extends `react-library.json` and
lints with `@williecubed/eslint-config/react-internal`.

The Astro site has a `sync` script that runs `astro sync`, and the Astro example's `turbo.json` has
a `sync` task that `lint` depends on. Astro generates the types for `astro:content` and its
environment only when it syncs or builds, so on a clean checkout, as in CI, type-aware lint rules
would otherwise reject every module that imports them. Turbo caches the generated `.astro/`
directory, so the extra task costs nothing when the content hasn't changed. The React example's
`turbo.json` has no `sync` task, because nothing in it runs `astro sync`; `pnpm standards:update`
adds the task to any repository that gains an Astro package.

## Adding an example

Copy `examples/basic`, change what the profile needs, and add it to the table above, to the
`examples` map in `tests/example.test.mjs` so it is proven on every check, and to
`standards/repositories.json` as a `template` with its `example`, so each release publishes it. Keep
the standard scripts and the catalog identical across examples.
