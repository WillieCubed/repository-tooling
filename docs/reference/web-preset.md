# Web preset

The `willie-web` preset vendors an exact repository-tooling snapshot into
`.williecubed/web-platform/`. It contains the shared packages, dependency catalog, Astro and React
templates, and the updater. Consumer configuration imports these packages through local `file:`
dependencies; shared rules remain owned by repository-tooling.

Published template repositories receive this snapshot automatically. The publication workflow copies
the authoritative example, applies the exact release tag, rewrites its `@williecubed/*`
dependencies, and generates the lockfile. Repeating publication for the same example and tag is
idempotent.

`.williecubed/web-platform.json` records the format version, preset name, source commit, and SHA-256
content hash. A published snapshot also records its release tag. An unpublished snapshot records
`null` as its release. The hash covers the sorted file paths and exact UTF-8 contents. Integrity
validation reads local files only and rejects edited, missing, additional, and symbolic-link files.

Release tags identify standards that have completed consumer validation and publication. Work under
review uses a full commit SHA instead. Branch names, short SHAs, and sequential prerelease tags do
not identify development snapshots.

## Update a consumer

Run the vendored updater through the repository's standard command:

```sh
pnpm standards:update --release v0.3.0 --dry-run --json
pnpm standards:update --release v0.3.0 --apply
pnpm install
pnpm check
```

The updater fetches one explicit tag from `WillieCubed/repository-tooling`. Dry run reports added,
changed, and removed files without changing the consumer. Apply replaces the vendor tree and its
provenance record. Locally edited vendor files stop the update rather than being erased. Commit the
vendor diff, provenance, and regenerated lockfile together after reviewing the catalog and
templates.

The update runs with the updater carried by the preset it installs, so a release's own changes apply
in the same update. It also makes three small migrations in the consumer's own files and lists every
file they touch under `consumerChanged`, in the dry run as well. It rewrites legacy
`@lasvegasfortransit/*` references to the platform packages as `@williecubed/*`, skipping
`.claude/worktrees/` and any other nested checkout. It adds the ignore rules the examples carry to
the consumer's root ignore files where they are missing, and leaves every existing line, comment,
and entry in place. A rule already written another way that covers the same paths, such as
`.claude/worktrees/**`, counts as present, and added lines keep the file's line endings:

- `.gitignore` gets Playwright's output (`test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, `blob-report/`, and
  `**/playwright/.cache/`) and agent worktrees (`.claude/worktrees/`).
- `.prettierignore` gets `.claude/worktrees/`.
- `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` gets `.claude/worktrees` as the first entry of its `ignores`. A YAML or
  JavaScript markdownlint configuration isn't edited; the update prints a warning naming the rule to
  add.

Claude Code creates each agent worktree, a full checkout of the same repository, under
`.claude/worktrees/` inside the checkout, and without these rules another session's files fail this
checkout's checks. In a repository with an Astro project, a package that depends on `astro` and has
its own `astro.config.*`, the updater also gives each one a `sync` script (`astro sync`) and adds a
`sync` task to `turbo.json` that `lint` depends on, so lint reads Astro's generated types on a clean
checkout. The update works out every migration before it writes any file, so a consumer file it
can't read stops the update with nothing changed. Nothing else in application configuration or
product files changes.

Consumer validation against an unpublished standard uses the reviewed commit directly:

```sh
pnpm standards:update --commit <full-commit-sha> --dry-run --json
pnpm standards:update --commit <full-commit-sha> --apply
pnpm install
pnpm check
```

The development snapshot keeps `release: null`. After publication, consumers update to the tagged
release commit and review its new commit and content hash.

For first adoption, run
`node standards/web-platform-cli.ts update --root /path/to/consumer --release v0.3.0 --apply` from a
repository-tooling checkout. A local tagged source is selected with
`--source /path/to/repository-tooling`. Use `--release <tag>` for a published standard or
`--commit <full-commit-sha>` for work under review. Both modes read committed files rather than the
working tree. Add consumer scripts pointing to the vendored CLI and local dependencies pointing to
its `packages/` directory.

## Recovery

Restore the vendor directory, provenance record, package manifests, and lockfile from the same
known-good consumer commit, then run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm check`. Do not
recalculate the recorded hash to accept a local edit. Fix the shared source and update from its
reviewed commit.
