# Platform manifest reference

A platform manifest is a file named `platform.json` that lists everything one app needs in
production: its Cloudflare Worker, D1 databases, R2 buckets, Turnstile widgets, Access applications,
email sending domain, secrets, vars, GitHub environment secrets, and the values that must never be
set there. The repository owns it. It lives next to the app's production `wrangler.jsonc`, usually
at `apps/<app>/platform.json`, or at the repository root for a single-app repository. It never lives
under `.williecubed/`, because that directory is vendored.

`pnpm preflight --production` compares the manifest with what exists and prints a readiness report.
`pnpm bootstrap --production` sets up what is missing. `pnpm check` validates the manifest's shape
on every commit through `cube check platform`. The [command reference](cli.md#production-checks)
describes the commands; this page describes the file.

The schema ships in `@williecubed/cli` as `platform.schema.json`. Point `$schema` at it so an editor
completes and checks the fields as you type:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/@williecubed/cli/platform.schema.json",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "example.org",
  "cloudflare": {
    "accountId": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    "zone": { "name": "example.org", "id": "fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210" },
    "worker": "example"
  },
  "d1": [{ "binding": "DB", "name": "example", "migrations": "migrations" }],
  "secrets": [
    {
      "name": "SIGNING_SECRET",
      "purpose": "Signs one-time links so they cannot be forged.",
      "generate": true
    }
  ],
  "forbidden": [
    {
      "name": "PREVIEW_ADMIN_KEY",
      "reason": "It opens the admin views without sign-in, so it belongs only on the preview."
    }
  ]
}
```

WPP's manifest at `apps/site/platform.json` in `WillieCubed/wpp` is the reference: a Worker, a D1
database, a KV namespace, an Access application, secrets, and zone rules.

## Top-level fields

| Field        | Required | Meaning                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$schema`    | no       | The path to `platform.schema.json`, for editors.                         |
| `version`    | yes      | Always `1`.                                                              |
| `name`       | yes      | What people call the production site, such as `party.willie.page`.       |
| `cloudflare` | yes      | The account, zone, and Worker. See below.                                |
| `d1`         | no       | D1 databases the Worker binds.                                           |
| `r2`         | no       | R2 buckets the Worker binds.                                             |
| `turnstile`  | no       | Turnstile widgets.                                                       |
| `access`     | no       | Cloudflare Access applications.                                          |
| `zoneRules`  | no       | Bot Fight Mode and rate-limit rules scoped to the app's hostname.        |
| `email`      | no       | Domains the Worker sends email from.                                     |
| `secrets`    | no       | Secret values on the Worker or in GitHub environments. Never the values. |
| `vars`       | no       | Plain-text vars that must be in the wrangler config.                     |
| `github`     | no       | The repository whose environments hold `github:` secrets.                |
| `forbidden`  | no       | Names that must never be set in production.                              |

## `cloudflare`

| Field            | Required | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accountId`      | yes      | The 32-character ID of the account that owns the Worker and the zone.                   |
| `zone.name`      | yes      | The zone, such as `willie.page`.                                                        |
| `zone.id`        | yes      | The zone's 32-character ID, from the zone's Overview page in the dashboard.             |
| `worker`         | yes      | The production Worker's name. It must equal `name` in the wrangler config.              |
| `wranglerConfig` | no       | The production wrangler config, relative to the manifest. Defaults to `wrangler.jsonc`. |

The check reads the wrangler config's top-level `name`, `vars`, `d1_databases`, and `r2_buckets`. It
does not read `env.*` sections.

## `d1` and `r2`

| Field        | Required | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `binding`    | yes      | The binding name in the wrangler config, such as `DB`.                                 |
| `name`       | yes      | The database or bucket name in Cloudflare.                                             |
| `migrations` | no (D1)  | The migrations directory, relative to the manifest. Every `.sql` file must be applied. |

The check fails when the database or bucket does not exist, when the wrangler config does not bind
it under `binding`, and when the config's `database_id` differs from the real database. It reads the
applied migrations from the database's `d1_migrations` table (or the `migrations_table` the config
names) with a read-only query. Setup applies only migrations that are not applied yet, and only
while the config's `database_id` is the real database's, because Wrangler applies them to the
database the config names.

## `turnstile`

| Field        | Required | Meaning                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`       | yes      | The widget's name in the dashboard.                                            |
| `domains`    | yes      | The hostnames the widget runs on.                                              |
| `mode`       | no       | `managed` (the default), `non-interactive`, or `invisible`.                    |
| `siteKeyVar` | yes      | The var that carries the public site key. It must be listed in `vars`.         |
| `secret`     | yes      | The Worker secret that carries the secret key. It must be listed in `secrets`. |

Setup creates the widget when none has this name or covers these domains, stores its secret key on
the Worker, and prints the site key to put in the wrangler config's `vars`. When it widens an
existing widget to cover more domains, it keeps the widget's other settings.

## `access`

| Field              | Required | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | yes      | The application's name in Zero Trust.                                                                                                                                        |
| `destinations`     | yes      | Host and path pairs to protect. List both `example.org/admin` and `example.org/admin/*`: a path does not cover the paths under it, and a wildcard does not cover its parent. |
| `sessionDuration`  | no       | How long a sign-in lasts, such as `24h`. Defaults to `24h`.                                                                                                                  |
| `identityProvider` | yes      | `onetimepin` for an emailed code (the default for personal repositories), `google` for Google accounts, or `google-apps` for Google Workspace.                               |
| `allow`            | yes      | Exactly one of `emails`, `emailDomain`, or `googleGroup` (a Workspace group address).                                                                                        |
| `teamDomainSecret` | yes      | The Worker secret that carries the Zero Trust team domain.                                                                                                                   |
| `audienceSecret`   | yes      | The Worker secret that carries the application's audience (AUD) tag.                                                                                                         |

Setup creates a reusable policy named `<name> allow` for the declared people, then the application,
with instant sign-in through the one identity provider, then stores the new audience tag on the
Worker straight away, since any older one belongs to another application. It stores the team domain
only when the `teamDomainSecret` is not set yet. The check fails when the application does not
protect a declared path, has another session length, offers another identity provider, lacks an
allow policy for the declared people, or has an allow policy that lets everyone in; fixing that last
one detaches the policy that lets everyone in.

When the account has no Zero Trust organization yet, setup creates one with the team domain from the
standard's defaults, and when the declared identity provider is missing, setup adds it. Both have
Cloudflare API endpoints, so no dashboard step is needed. `onetimepin` needs nothing else. A
`google` provider needs an OAuth client id and secret, which the manifest lists as secrets with
steps. Setup cannot read Google Groups, so for a `googleGroup` it asks the person to confirm the
group exists and remembers a yes on that computer; until then, the group is reported as a warning.

## `zoneRules`

Protection that runs at the zone, before the Worker, so a blocked request costs nothing.

| Field                   | Required | Meaning                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `botFightMode`          | no       | `true` to require Bot Fight Mode on the zone.                                       |
| `rateLimits`            | no       | Rate-limit rules, each scoped to the app's hostname.                                |
| `rateLimits[].name`     | yes      | The rule's name in the dashboard, such as `Throttle RSVP writes`.                   |
| `rateLimits[].paths`    | yes      | Path prefixes the rule counts, such as `/rsvp/`.                                    |
| `rateLimits[].requests` | yes      | Requests allowed per period from one IP address.                                    |
| `rateLimits[].period`   | yes      | The counting period in seconds. The free plan allows only `10`.                     |
| `rateLimits[].blockFor` | yes      | How long a blocked IP address stays blocked, in seconds. The free plan allows `10`. |

Every rule includes a hostname condition for the app. A zone such as `willie.page` carries several
apps, and a rule without the hostname would throttle the other apps' paths too. The check fails when
a declared rule is missing, has different limits, or lacks the hostname condition. The in-Worker
rate-limit binding stays the real per-client limit; the zone rule stops floods.

## `email`

| Field          | Required | Meaning                                                                                |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain`       | yes      | The domain in the From address.                                                        |
| `provider`     | yes      | `resend`. The provider decides which DNS records are checked.                          |
| `region`       | no       | The provider's sending region. Defaults to `us-east-1`.                                |
| `apiKeySecret` | no       | The Worker secret that carries the provider's API key. It must be listed in `secrets`. |

For Resend, the check looks up the `send` MX and SPF records and the `resend._domainkey` DKIM
record, which production needs, and the `_dmarc` record, which it recommends. It uses public DNS, so
it needs no credential.

## `secrets`

| Field         | Required | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | yes      | The name in capitals, such as `RESEND_API_KEY`.                                                                                                                            |
| `purpose`     | yes      | What production uses it for, in one sentence.                                                                                                                              |
| `use`         | no       | `live` (the default): production is not ready without it. `future`: only a feature that is not built yet needs it, so it only warns.                                       |
| `neededFor`   | no       | The feature that does not work without it, as a phrase that follows "needed for".                                                                                          |
| `targets`     | no       | Where it is stored: `worker`, or `github:<environment>`. Defaults to `worker`.                                                                                             |
| `url`         | no       | The page to open first. Setup offers to open it.                                                                                                                           |
| `steps`       | no       | Numbered, click-by-click steps to find or create the value, each one complete sentence. See the rules below.                                                               |
| `generate`    | no       | `true` when setup should mint a random value (32 random bytes) instead of asking.                                                                                          |
| `sensitive`   | no       | `false` for a value that is not a credential, such as an account ID, a team domain, or an Access audience tag. Setup asks for it visibly and shows it. Defaults to `true`. |
| `from`        | no       | `cloudflare.accountId` to copy the manifest's account ID.                                                                                                                  |
| `pattern`     | no       | A regular expression a pasted value must match.                                                                                                                            |
| `patternHint` | no       | What a valid value looks like, shown when a pasted value does not match.                                                                                                   |

Write `steps` for someone who has never used the service. Say exactly what to type or choose in each
field, and use the same names the manifest uses, so setup recognizes what the person makes. Never
ask for a second copy before the first is pasted: the step that copies a value also says where to
paste it, and the last step copies the value this secret needs, to paste at the prompt. When a value
is needed in two places, say to paste it in both before copying anything else. The standard's own
guides follow the same rules.

A secret gets its value from exactly one place: `generate`, `from`, a Turnstile widget or Access
application that names it, or a person. A secret a person types in must have `steps`, so the person
is never left guessing where the value comes from; the
[set-up guide](../how-to/set-up-production.md#what-to-enter-in-each-dashboard) has reviewed steps
for the common ones to copy. A value a Turnstile widget or Access application feeds is asked for
only when setup cannot read it, and then with the standard's own steps, which walk through creating
the resource. Prefer `generate` or a value a created resource feeds over a typed secret: every typed
secret is a step a person repeats when production is rebuilt, as
[Rebuilding from source](../explanation/continuity.md) explains.

Setup hides only credentials. A secret marked `"sensitive": false` is typed with visible input, and
its value is printed when setup stores it and shown in the report beside "is set", as the value that
should be there, whenever setup can work it out (the account ID, the team domain, or an
application's audience tag). A generated secret is always a credential. Every other secret is typed
hidden and never printed.

Setup can see only whether a secret exists, never its value. So it never replaces a secret that is
set: it does not ask for it, generate it, or copy it again. A resource created during a run always
stores its new value, since any older one is stale. A generated secret that is set on one target but
missing from another is reported, not generated again, because a second random value would leave the
targets disagreeing. To replace a value on purpose, run
`pnpm bootstrap --production --rotate <NAME>`.

## `vars`

| Field       | Required | Meaning                                           |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | yes      | The var's name.                                   |
| `purpose`   | yes      | What production uses it for, in one sentence.     |
| `use`       | no       | `live` (the default) or `future`, as for secrets. |
| `neededFor` | no       | As for secrets.                                   |

A var must be in the wrangler config's `vars`, because a deploy replaces every var with what the
config says. Setup never edits the config. It prints the line to add, so the change goes through
review. A var that a Turnstile widget feeds must equal that widget's site key.

## `github`

| Field        | Required | Meaning                                                                   |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repository` | yes      | `owner/name`. Required when any secret or forbidden entry targets GitHub. |

Setup creates a missing environment before it stores the environment's secrets.

## `forbidden`

| Field      | Required | Meaning                                                           |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | yes      | The name that must not be set.                                    |
| `reason`   | yes      | Why, in one sentence the report prints.                           |
| `targets`  | no       | As for secrets. Defaults to `worker`.                             |
| `severity` | no       | `error` (the default) fails the check; `warning` only reports it. |

On the Worker, the check looks for the name as a secret, in the wrangler config's `vars`, and in the
deployed Worker's vars. A name cannot be both declared and forbidden. Use `warning` for a temporary
switch that production is allowed to carry for a while, such as a var that turns a check off until
its service is set up.

## Rules the schema cannot express

`cube check platform` also fails when a name is declared twice, when a resource feeds a secret or
var the manifest does not declare, when a fed secret does not target the Worker, when an Access
application allows a Google group without the `google-apps` identity provider, when a GitHub target
has no `github.repository`, and when a `pattern` is not a valid regular expression.
